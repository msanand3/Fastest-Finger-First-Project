Project Title: 	FIRST RESPONSE DETECTOR CIRCUIT

Contributers: 	Palak Singhal 	16CO129
		Sharanya Kamath 16CO140


Idea: 

The idea of this mini project is to create a circuit which determines which participant has reponded the earliest.
These type of circuits are useful in the buzzer rounds of quiz shows.

Applications:

In first response rounds of quiz contests, the question is thrown open to all the teams.
The person who knows the answer hits his switch first and then answers the question. 
Sometimes two or more players hit the switch almost simultaneously and it is very difficult to detect which of
them has pressed the switch first.

Usage:

The switches of the players are pressed in any order.
The number of the player whose switch was pressed first is displayed on the display.
Pressing other player switches does not affect the winner's number on the display.
To reset, all the players' switches are switched off.

Functionalities:

IC 74LS75 4bit bistable latch: 	Used to lock the input of the player whose response was the earliest.
				The enables of this IC automatically become 0 after passing the first input.
				Hence the IC does not pass the inputs of the players who pressed their switches later.

IC 74147- Priority Encoder:	Priority encoder encodes the active-low input condition into the
				corresponding binary coded decimal (BCD) number output.

IC 74LS04- Hex Inverter:	This IC consists of NOT gates which convert the active-low output of the
				priority encoder into active-high.

IC 74LS47-
BCD to 7 segment decoder: 	This decoder converts the BCD active-high inputs to corresponding 7 segment inputs
				for the 7 segment LED display.
